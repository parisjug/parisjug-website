Fabrice Mouhartem got a PhD in privacy-preserving cryptography, mainly designing provable constructions from both pre and post-quantum assumptions. Since then, he worked both in academia and industry and he is now part of the CryptPad squad at XWiki SAS as a R&D engineer.

CryptPad is an open-source end-to-end encrypted collaborative office suite distributed as a web application. Putting the security of end users first, Fabrice helps improving the security of CryptPad and also works on other improvements for CryptPad backend, especially scalability.

Being an open-source enthusiast, Fabrice found in CryptPad the opportunity to conciliate both FOSS and cryptography. He was a speaker at various open source events such as FOSDEM, JdLL, Capitole du Libre, OW2Con and Pass the Salt.
